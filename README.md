I have created this using HTML, CSS and JS with Firebase.
JQuery is also used for some tasks.
I have created a tab panel and also an image slider additionally.
I have used my own firebase config but when i tried to use the one provided the result was also the same.
Website is also responsive completely with the exception of image slider but I am working on its responsive design.
Vercel has been used to deploy this website.
